  title: Collection of personal information
  details: >
    TxnDuck does not collect or store any personal information (name, email address, etc) or any
    diagnostic data. It does not log any usage information. It does not use any third-party
    analytics or advertising platforms.
app_state_data:
  title: Storage of application state data
  details: All of txnDuckâ€™s application state data (temporary transaction data, user preferences and
    selected language, etc.) is stored <strong>only</strong> your device. TxnDuck will
    <strong>never</strong> transmit any of the application state data to anywhere outside your
    device without your permission.
wallet_security:
  title: Wallet account and private keys
  details: >
    TxnDuck will never directly collect or store any of your private keys or passphrases. Instead,
    txnDuck uses a wallet service, such as <wc>WalletConnect</wc> or <pcdocs>Pera Connect</pcdocs>,
    to connect to your wallet account without accessing your private key(s). This means txnDuck
    cannot and will not access your funds or your assets without your explicit permission, which you
    grant through a wallet application, such as <pera>Pera</pera> and <defly>Defly</defly>.
