personal_info:
  heading: Collection of personal information
  details: >-
    Except for the <magic_section>personal information collected when using
    Magic</magic_section>, txnDuck does not collect or store any personal information (name, email
    address, etc.) or any diagnostic data. It does not log any usage information. It does not use
    any third-party analytics or advertising platforms.
app_state_data:
  heading: Storage of application state data
  details: >-
    All of txnDuck’s application state data (temporary transaction data, user preferences, selected
    language, etc.) is stored <strong>only</strong> your device. TxnDuck will <strong>never</strong>
    transmit any of the application state data to anywhere outside your device without your
    permission.
wallet_security:
  heading: Wallet account and private keys
  details: >-
    TxnDuck will never directly collect or store any of your private keys or passphrases. Instead,
    txnDuck uses a wallet service, such as <wc>WalletConnect</wc> or <pcdocs>Pera Connect</pcdocs>,
    to connect to your wallet account without accessing your private key(s). This means txnDuck
    cannot and will not access your funds or your assets without your explicit permission, which you
    grant through a wallet application, such as <pera>Pera</pera> and <defly>Defly</defly>.

    This personal information is kept by Magic and accessible to the txnDuck developer for
    <strong>up to 30 days</strong> through a developer "Dashboard" provided by Magic. This
