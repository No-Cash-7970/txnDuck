sending Algorand transactions without the need for software development
knowledge.

## :globe_with_meridians: Websites

txn<span style="color:#0ebd9d">Duck</span> is available to use for free
(excluding any Algorand network fees) at the following websites:

**Production:** <https://txnduck.vercel.app>  
Preview: <https://txnduck-preview.vercel.app>

The Production website hosts the latest stable release (the `stable` branch)
where are all of the features are considered complete and stable. On the other
hand, the Preview website usually hosts the unstable version (the `main` branch)
with the latest developments, so it may have incomplete and/or unstable features
that have yet to be released. There may be times when both websites are the
same.

## :sparkles: Features

- FUTURE: Support for multiple languages and locales
- FUTURE: Specify custom algod node
- FUTURE: Export to a signed or unsigned transaction file that is compatible
  with Algorand's `goal` tool
- FUTURE: Import a transaction file
- FUTURE: Build transaction groups (atomic transactions)

<!-- TODO: Show table of supported language (i18n) -->

## :computer: Set up and run locally

**This is not for development. To set up and run txnDuck for development,
follow the instruction for
[installing for development](#hammer_and_wrench-installation-for-development).**

Instead of using one of the [official txnDuck websites](#globe_with_meridians-websites), you can
choose to download the source code and run a of the software "locally" on your
own computer that does not rely on an external website.

### Requirements for local setup

- Access to your machine's command line interface (CLI), such as Terminal,
  PowerShell or Command Prompt
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version 18.0.0 or higher installed
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) package manager installed

### Installing the local setup

1. Download the source code.
    - Production (`stable` branch):
      <https://github.com/No-Cash-7970/txnDuck/archive/refs/heads/stable.zip>
    - Preview (`main` branch):
      <https://github.com/No-Cash-7970/txnDuck/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>
2. Unzip the downloaded source code. You should now have a new folder that
   contains a bunch of files and folder, which include "public" and "yarn.lock".
3. Open the <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> and go to the folder
   created in step #2 by running the following in the CLI. Of course, replace
   `PATH/TO/SOURCE_CODE/FOLDER` with the actual path to the folder.

    ```bash
    cd PATH/TO/SOURCE_CODE/FOLDER
    ```

4. Install and build the source code dependencies.

    ```bash
    yarn install --prod && yarn build
    ```

5. Run the web server.

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

6. Open a web browser and go to <http://localhost:3000> to start using your
   local txnDuck! :tada: The web server must be running in the
   <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> to use your local txnDuck.
7. (Optional) If you are finished using your local txnDuck, stop the web server
   by closing the <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> window or by
   pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>C</kbd>
   (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>C</kbd> on Mac) while in the
   <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr>. You can restart the web
   server by following Step #5.

### Uninstalling and removing local setup

1. Make sure the web server is not running. Stop the server if it is. Refer to
   step #7 in the ["Installing local setup" instructions](#installing-local-setup).
2. Delete the source code folder.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation for development

Refer to the installation instructions in the [Developers Documentation](docs/DEVELOPERS.md).
