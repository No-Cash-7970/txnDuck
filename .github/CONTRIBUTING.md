## Code of conduct

Help us keep txnDuck open and inclusive. Please read and the follow [Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Legal notice

When contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100% of
the content, that you have the necessary rights to the content, and that the
content you contribute may be provided under the project license.

## Asking a question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/No-Cash-7970/txnDuck/issues)
that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need
clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable
to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we
recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/No-Cash-7970/txnDuck/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, yarn, etc), depending on what
  seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

## Submitting translations

A goal for txnDuck is to make it accessible to as many people as possible, so
having the txnDuck user interface translated into as many languages as possible
is important.

### Before submitting or editing a translation

- Make sure you are using the latest version. Fork the `main` branch of the
  repository and make sure that fork is up to date.
- [Install](../docs/DEVELOPERS.md#installing-the-development-environment) and
  [use](../docs/DEVELOPERS.md#running-the-development-web-server) the
  development environment to test the translations.
- Look in the [`locales` directory](../src/app/i18n/locales/) to see if the
  translation exists already.
- Check the current status of the language translations in the table in the
  [*Supported languages* section in the
  README](../README.md#speech_balloon-supported-languages).

### How do I submit a new translation?

Submitting a new translation is a specific type of code change. We use GitHub
pull requests to track and manage code changes from the community. To submit a
translation:

1. Put the language files containing the translations in a new directory in
   [`/src/app/i18n/locales`](../src/app/i18n/locales/). Use the language's
   [ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
   as the name of the new directory.
2. Add the language data to the object of supported languages (`supportedLangs`)
   in the [Internationalization (I18n) settings](../src/app/i18n/settings.ts).

   For example, if `supportedLangs` in the [i18n settings](../src/app/i18n/settings.ts)
   looked something like this:

   ```typescript
   /**
    * Collection of supported languages
    */
   export const supportedLangs: LanguageData = {
     en: {
       name: 'English', // Shown on language button if it is the current language
       listName: 'English (US)', // Shown in language menu
     },
     // ADD DATA FOR NEW LANGUAGE HERE
   };
   ```

   Then after adding Spanish
   ([ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) "es"),
   `supportedLangs` should look like this:

   ```typescript
   /**
    * Collection of supported languages
    */
   export const supportedLangs: LanguageData = {
     en: {
       name: 'English', // Shown on language button if it is the current language
       listName: 'English (US)', // Shown in language menu
     },
     es: {
       name: 'Espa√±ol',
       listName: 'Espa√±ol (Traducci√≥n autom√°tica)',
     },
     // ADD DATA FOR NEW LANGUAGE HERE
   };
   ```

3. Open a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/No-Cash-7970/txnDuck/pulls).
   - Provide the language of the translation in the title **in English**.
   - If updating a translation, describe those updates in the pull request
     description **in English**.

<!-- #### Font for new translation -->

<!-- TODO: Add instructions on how to add font for a language that needs more than Latin characters -->

### How do I fix or edit an existing translation?

Edit the files in the directory for the language in the [`locales`
directory](../src/app/i18n/locales/). For example, edit the files `es` directory
to edit the Spanish translation.

## Reporting bugs

### Before submitting a bug report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to prod you for more
information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information
and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following
steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using
  incompatible environment components/versions. If you are looking for support,
  you might want to check [this section](#asking-a-question).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the
  same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing
  for your bug or error in the [bug
  tracker](https://github.com/No-Cash-7970/txnDuck/labels/bug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if
  users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package
    manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with
    older versions?

### How do I submit a good bug report?

**:warning: You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or
bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in
public. Refer to the [security policy](SECURITY.md) for reporting sensitive
bugs.**

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the
project:

- Open a new [Issue](https://github.com/No-Cash-7970/txnDuck/issues/new). (Since
  we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to
  talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction
  steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This
  usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the
  problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If
  there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the
  team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs
  with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as
  well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left
  to be implemented by someone.
